# INDIVIDUAL PROJECT PART A

## Step 1:
World Development Indicators (WDI) are the World Bank's most comprehensive collection of development data that is comparable across countries. This database consists of 1400 timeseries indicators for 217 economies for more than 40country groups over 50 years.
Most of the data themes in the website are Poverty and Inequality, People, environment, economy, states and markets and Global links. It provides information about the countries on education, economy, health and many more.

## Step 2:
Explored the data "https://github.com/GunduSriBhanu/data690_fall2022/blob/main/data690_world_dev/data/Education_wdx_data_2010_2015.csv" from website "https://www.worlddev.xyz/", analysed different indicators from Health, Education and Economy. Performed analysis using distribution charts, scatter plots and line charts over years. From this analysis, I choose the topic **Importance of education and Unemployment in G20 Countries** and will implement as story in "www.medium.com"

## Step 3: Importance of education and Unemployment in G20 Countries
The topics that interested me are Education, Unemployment for the population of group age 25+ in G20 countries over the years 2010 to 2015. The indicators analyzed are :

The G20 Countries are : 'Argentina', 'Australia', 'Brazil', 'Canada', 'China', 'France',
       'Germany', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Korea, Rep.',
       'Mexico', 'Russian Federation', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Africa',
       'Turkiye', 'United Kingdom' and 'United States'.

Initially, analyzed the data with population for these G20 countries:
![image](https://github.com/GunduSriBhanu/data690_fall2022/blob/main/data690_world_dev/Charts/2013_Tot_pop.png)
The population for China and India is highest while the lowest population is for Canada, Saudi Arabia and Australia.

Then the data is mostly on the population of age 25+ over the regions are:

Later, analyzed the education completion for the countries:

From the data, the countries contributing for education and population who completed masters in United States, United Kingdom and Australia is the highest among G20 countries and contributing for highest literacy rate.

Later analysed the unemployment trends,

Later, the unemployment trends are more in South Africa and lowest in Korea and Japan. Which means Japan and korea are utilising maximum man power even though the population is lowest.

Later, analysed the educational expenditure on the countries:
![image](https://github.com/GunduSriBhanu/data690_fall2022/blob/main/data690_world_dev/Charts/Educ_Expenditure_2013.png)
I observed that the India and china are contributing very less on education. eventhough, the population is more. South Arabia is contributing more on education.

From the unemployment and education expenditure,
![image](https://github.com/GunduSriBhanu/data690_fall2022/blob/main/data690_world_dev/Charts/2013_Unemploy_vs_EducExpenditure.png)
observed the trends that the highest population countries are contributing less on education with low unemployment ratio and the countries like Germany, contributing for the education is highest with lowest unemployment is for Saudi Arabia. From my analysis of G20 countries Sausi Arabia is more towrds the development among G20 countries for education.

Finally, based on the trends analysed for all the years for the countries United states, China, India, Australia
![image](https://github.com/GunduSriBhanu/data690_fall2022/blob/main/data690_world_dev/Charts/Unemploy_over_years_Sel_Cou.png)
From the observations, Australia is providing more importance to the education, and the expenditure on education is highest from 2012 comapred to USA.
Unemployment decreased in USA is highest in the year 2015, compared to Australia.
From all these observations, even though the population of India and China is highest, the funds provided to these countries are lower and maintained almost constant unemployment.
USA and Australia are developing in terms of education and employment.

## Conclusion on Analysis:
USA and Australia contributing more for education and simulataneously contributing to improve the employment rate over years. Saudi Arabia is contributing more on education with highest percentage of education expenditure and with lower unemployment rate in 2013. Japan and Korea are the countries with highest employment rate even though the contribution on education is less.
