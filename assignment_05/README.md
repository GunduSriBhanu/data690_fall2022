# Data Analysis with Python

     Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing and transforming data for extracting useful information with programming languages like Python, julia and R because these are open source, free and extremely powerful. Python is ideal for data analysis because it is simple to learn with powerful libraries.

## Data Analysis Process
The process of data analysis starts with:
* **Data Extraction:** extracting data from SQL, scrapping, file formats, consulting APIs and distributed databases
* **Data Cleaning:** checking and handling missing values, duplicate values, incorrect data types, outliers detections, non relevant data.
* **Data Wrangling:** handling categorical data, merging, indexing, reshaping, combining and joining data.
* **Analysis:** Exploration of data, correlation, statistical analysis and visualization of data.
* **Action:** Building Machine learning models, ETL pipelines building, live dashboards creation.
